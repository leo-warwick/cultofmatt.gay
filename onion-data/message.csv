*Passive aggressive please pay because this is an unlimited free trial you should pay for*
Vscode just feels good because it‚Äôs so minimal but isn‚Äôt slow af as atom. Also I don‚Äôt feel any pressure to buy something unlike sublime <:kekw:775423225400262656>
Except maybe html/css because it has Live Server
Think everything tbh
Only thing vscode doesn‚Äôt do well is gui builder
But it‚Äôs better than atom at this point because I think ms moved all their resources over
It‚Äôs basically atom because they ported it <:kekw:775423225400262656>
Vscode actually so customisable

"Which tbf, steam has always been a monopoly which I like health competition with EGS"
Nah I meant that as why people don‚Äôt like it. They think that it‚Äôll cause the fall for steam
Also heard they‚Äôre gonna only port Sony games to epic store which is good (abs epic forced Sony to do cross platform which is good for everyone)
Stream dominates the pc gaming store. So I like epic games because they offer a lower commission for each sale so more developers choose epic games over steam
I honestly hope steam does tho
Except it‚Äôs trying to be a new monopoly
Nothing
Which it‚Äôs only recently C# since unity
The main issue is that the AAA companies are essentially preventing the progression of games development in languages other than C++ and C# üôÑ
Some are. Epic games if deffo one of them. Smaller indie ones tend to be nice. Devolver is awesome

"I got perma banned for asking why asking for an emoji is against the terms of service of the UWCS discord server, this is violent abuse of authoritarian, left-wing politics. Boris John introduced the university free-speech champion that helps free speech (and emoji use). Therefore, by law, we can get the champion to fight for us to allow the emoji to be used in the server and reduce the segregation of the first years and upcoming first years."
This is like how a barber makes one mistake and then you have to go bald
Ask it in UWCS because this is a cesspool atm
I swear someone just said no tho

Calm
Yall need to calm down
Idk why people are still dragging it on tho
"Tbf I honestly am not bothered too much about being banned, it‚Äôs justified"
Apparently sending the emoji is not as bad than asking why it‚Äôs an offence
"Oh well, back to the coal mines for me <:withered:812676885607219231>"
Did they say?
Again?
What happened?
Joe Oakley deserves his UWCS presentation (if he hasn‚Äôt done it already)
Can we all please calm down? This has blown out of proportion and it‚Äôs been made into a bigger deal that it actually is. If they don‚Äôt want to add an emoji then it‚Äôs not that deep and who really cares. Yeah it‚Äôs annoying for people who don‚Äôt have nitro but still. Let‚Äôs just call it a day and get back to revision because we all have exams and need to pass them and can‚Äôt be dealing with all this drama. #letsallgetalong

Dmitry forgot the answe so asked Reddit <:salute:834165255390101554>

What extensions did you do?

Also because I used maps and he said I should‚Äôve explained why they were better than lists and I said I used maps because lists are O(n) whereas maps are O(n log n)
I‚Äôm a bit sad tbh
Yeah I swear he said functions weren‚Äôt and now saying they are??
This tbh haha
People with 0
I feel dumb kekw
Just wondering if any answers to a or b
Dw I got tricked by that I think
Because a = b and b = a implies a = b
It is isn‚Äôt it?
Because R= is a partial order
It‚Äôs still a partial order
So it is still a partial order
"Like it‚Äôs transitive, reflexive, symetttric and anti-symmetric"
a <= b and a>=b  => = which is all of them
That doesn‚Äôt work for a
It had to be trans
"Was 1A,b possible?"
Yeah I did 1d
Q2 was alright
We allowed to say answers now ye?

Legit the videos I found today so useful but I‚Äôm doing it in 5 minutes <:coolcry:815987579333640282>
Just not well
I‚Äôve done it
So the inverse either has 0 or 1 in domain
It‚Äôs either 1 or 0 in the codomain
How tho
?
So basically the inverse bijective function goes 1= A and 0 = !A
The exam will be easier probs cos time limit and no google

<:wah:816004140513099848>

Another stupid thing is how the plot starts off
Like legit I don‚Äôt care if captain America is black or not
Good luck <:kekw:775423225400262656>
I think the biggest issue with it is that it‚Äôs very experimental
Like legit first two episodes are the worst things I‚Äôve ever seen. Only really gets good when not in the sitcom <:kekw:775423225400262656>
That was so hyped that people thought it was better than it actually was
Imo it‚Äôs better than wandavision tho
I.e. a world without borders type deal
But it certainly is very socialist based
I wouldn‚Äôt say anti capitalist propaganda
"The falcon and the winter soldier is alright but imo the political views were thrown into it. Like I want to watch a superhero film, not politics <:kekw:775423225400262656>"
You probs would because they promote socialism in it <:kekw:775423225400262656>
It‚Äôs because they had like 100 different plot points and side stories that they just ignored <:kekw:775423225400262656>
"Like I thought it was alright but after watching their review, I totally get it"
"I love ign gave the final winter solder episode a 5/10, and people are so pissed <:kekw:775423225400262656>"

Like i can‚Äôt really remember exactly what topics but I remember me and shadow were talking about it ageees ago and I was really surprised at how much content was in normal maths compared to WJEC version
"WJEC teach you different things to most English alevel topics, it tends to cover core math stuff in FM"
"Pretty much, I did but because I fast tracked maths I didn‚Äôt really see me passing it lmao"
And got 3.5 <:kekw:775423225400262656>
I did the CTMUA
I didn‚Äôt really care that much <:kekw:775423225400262656>
I applied Cambridge
I did it tho <:kekw:775423225400262656>
Nope lol
"I didn‚Äôt say surprising, just kinda dumb it‚Äôs based on one year compared to 2"
"Nah honestly they weren‚Äôt lol, they failed the CTMUA, got 1"
"You do, A is max grade in AS"
"Nah, one person in my class had A in chem physics maths first year and got in for Psychology <:kekw:775423225400262656>"
But it‚Äôs kinda dead needing to get the max grade in every subject just to get an interview lmao
Whereas English ones don‚Äôt even have grades first year so you can kinda bullshit being bad <:kekw:775423225400262656>
Nah but WJEC means you get grades first year so they take that into account heavily
Because Ik someone who a 8 on the TMUA but got rejected because they had a B in physics <:withered:812676885607219231>
You get rejected based on your first year grades
They were for me because I was doing WJEC
"It was for Oxford tbf, originally I just cba doing Cambridge because I didn‚Äôt really want to stress about grades too much. But I was glad when I found out it was racist so that‚Äôs a plus lmao"
Oxford probs worse than Cambridge because the slave thing they said to me <:kekw:775423225400262656>
I kinda wanted to go but then gave up on the CTMUA because Cambridge / Oxford are both pretty racist
Um we gonna lose a boost this week <:kekw:775423225400262656>
Cos I‚Äôve seen it first hand. They essentially wanted me to take chemistry at degree level because they knew it would be waaaay easier to get in and said pick Cambridge Churchill college (which ngl but last time I went to Churchill it was alright but not somewhere I‚Äôd want to live for 3-4 years kekw)
That‚Äôs why I do think it‚Äôs kinda rigged sometimes
It was so bogus that for mock interviews that every subject except computer science had a professional to interview them. If I did chemistry I would get the Churchill college admissions tutor as my mock interviewer but instead the CS guy dipped and I had to have the principal instead who does humanities <:wah:816004140513099848>
"Nothing really tbh, just helped out with Ucas applications"
"One was someone who taught English at Oxford (it was rigged that her son was the main interviewer at Churchill college in Cambridge, everyone who applied there got in <:kekw:775423225400262656> ).  Another was a person who did a degree there who went to my college and the last one (who gave me 5A* <:kekw:775423225400262656> ) went to RADA"
I had like 3
"But then on my ucas review thingy I got a different oxbridge lecturer and they were like ‚Äúoh you need A* FM for your course, let‚Äôs give you that. Oh, may aswell give you physics aswell.‚Äù <:kekw:775423225400262656> <:kekw:775423225400262656> <:kekw:775423225400262656>"
"My oxbridge tutor was like less give you A* in everything your lectures think which was chemistry (which they really wanted me to apply with xD), Math and CS"

Why are we making it about how males are more likely to do stem then if stem aren‚Äôt the only important degrees??
You are gaslighting please stfu
Just inserts a chip into your brain
Neuralink lets him read minds
Technically Elon musk can now
This is called victim shaming
Warwick has 51% male / 49% female (basically the same) and 47% female staff and 53% male staff
I feel like they say women are intimidated by stem yet the majority of my female friends are stem? Whereas the majority of my male friends are BTEC/drop outs <:kekw:775423225400262656>
It‚Äôs a bit sexist saying unless your female? I get intimidated going to the doctor <:kekw:775423225400262656>
Yeah but that could also play a factor into stats if they did it because less people to get an accurate result
"Because if they have less female students, the statistics are rigged anyways"
Yeah but I don‚Äôt think this is the case
"I think it was just generally on the course, but gender doesn‚Äôt have anything to do with academical performance so doesn‚Äôt make sense tbh"
I applied Warwick tbf because just seems a little less based than other places
One of my lady friends from college got told that she would have a rough time there because she‚Äôs female by one of the lecturers on the open day and that male students tend to perform better (which is bs)
Although Bath cs sexist lmao
"Exact same, should‚Äôve picked Bath as went up in ratings <:wah:816004140513099848>"
Except lse
"London uses just seem based, expensive and overrated"
"But saying that, all London unis were not in my top 5 either lmao"
That‚Äôs one reason why I wouldn‚Äôt even stick it in my top 5 <:kekw:775423225400262656>
About Oxford? 100% not on that I‚Äôm afraid
Every uni based tbh
"Oxford based
Cambridge based
Warwick based"
"Thought so, did not like him tbh"
Cos the guy at oxford was a complete asshole
That Oxford ye?
The philosophy guy was a douche. Put me off Oxford all together tbh. And also the fact that when I went up their our guide said slavery was a good thing as otherwise Oxford university wouldn‚Äôt be built <:kekw:775423225400262656>

School shooting bad
How come?
The only people from my college that got into Cambridge had mock interviews with the actual Cambridge interviewers they had on the day so they had tea and biscuits in the mock interview and already had links before their real interview
"It‚Äôs like oxbridge, either links or money or smarter than the people teaching you"
Yeah you do
MIT is nice if you‚Äôve got a wallet to get in
They work for the F students because the F students are the ones that realise you wasted 4 years of your life doing a degree just to get minimum wage
Like Elon musk says. They are losers
Majority of the good unis in america are like ¬£50K a year
I am poor <:kekw:775423225400262656>

That‚Äôs a fair enough point for missing something once. But if your asking a question you should probably be listening
Yeah but don‚Äôt ask the same question over and over again without actually listening
"Nah not really, if you‚Äôre not paying attention, it‚Äôs your fault. Fair enough asking again once but I‚Äôd say do it in your own time after that"
"Not always, some people ask questions for the sake of it. Like I honestly hate the people who ask questions all the time because they weren‚Äôt listening. Like in college there was this person who went to my revision class who asked roughly 20 questions every time and some questions were repeated multiple times. He legit asked what recursion was about 3-4 times near the end of the year"

Some people say it‚Äôs transphobic
Yes

I guess you could use the three thingy

There was this girls group chat that got exposed the start of last term and they were basically saying like really sick things in there. One of the people where were saying the sick things is going for the equality role (which obviously they‚Äôre probably not suited for <:kekw:775423225400262656> )
I love that one of the people going for the Law society Equality officer was the same person who got exposed for being sexist at the start of term <:kekw:775423225400262656>

"Originally the Air was the lightest version, but now it‚Äôs pretty much the mid range iPad. Still the lightest but the iPad Air 4 (current one) has the A14 chip which is overall comparable to the A12Z of the iPad Pro ( which still outperforms A14 slightly in multi core performance). Pretty much the only reasons to get the pro is 
1. More storage
2. 120hz screen (sometimes)
3. Can get bigger size screen
Which tbf, for like a couple hundred pounds difference, it is a valid option to go with the air"

Herd immunity was pretty much bojo and the cum zone trying to kill off the old and vulnerable so they didn‚Äôt have to pay benefits for them

The new one you can deffo catch it way quicker
If you had covid then nobody should be leaving your house cos they‚Äôd never know lol
"You never know tho, some people are asymtomatic"

And then likelyhood is the people you talk to get it
You spread it
People aren‚Äôt as resistant to covid as you think mind
Ye that what I meant
Idiots
So it was the same people getting covid like 3-4 times lmao
The mutation helps it be resistant to antibodies due to being exposed to the same antibodies over and over again
Can‚Äôt find it right now but trust it‚Äôs likely to have come from uni students
Cos it mutated from dumb ass uni students lmao
"If you looked at how the new covid strain is speculated to be made, then it could be way higher than that"
Tho I did also see a post on Facebook if a healthy 18 year old girl who died of it

"(Cool story actually, this girl in comp told me ‚ÄúOi \*my name\*, you think you‚Äôre soooooo cool don‚Äôt you‚Äù and started giggling with her girl gang. Then I was like ‚ÄúNo I never considered myself cool‚Äù and it got real quiet in class. Then I said ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs cos I‚Äôm smoking HOT‚Äù and then boom everyone was ‚ÄúOOHHHHHHHHH‚Äù. The girl never made eye contact with me again lmao)"
2 if you‚Äôre funny like me ü•≤
Like you can be good looking but if you‚Äôre smart you go from an 8 to a 4 in some people‚Äôs books lol
"Tho tbf, idk why girls go for hanging ratbags lol"
Elaborate
Although there‚Äôs a substantial amount in both which is a big rip
If say there‚Äôs more abusive guys than girls in a relationship
Like girls get manipulated by dickheads a lot of the time
And then there‚Äôs a girl who wants to go out with a guy who cheats
Because guy is more likely to cheat on a girl
There‚Äôs deffo some horny girls
I reckon 50/50
Nah
Also there‚Äôs more females than males in the Uk
It‚Äôs about 50/50 I thought???
And why don‚Äôt they get likes ü§£
Then why is it considered gross and creepy if a guy posts a crotch pic for likes?
I‚Äôve got a question: Is it really female empowerment when a girl sticks up every picture of them self with a boob or bum pic just to get likes on insta?

"Well after the first vaccine got announced, seems like everyone else got done aswell ü§£"
and got done months before
They assumed it would be done like mid next year
Rushing it
Yeah but they weren't on a schedule
Especially considering America considers healthcare a business more than anything else
"Not a conspiracy theorist or anything, just that its kinda sketchy"
And then one vaccine say they're done and everyone comes out lmao
They were like 3-4 months ahead of the cometition
Basically I watched a documentary on it and the Oxford one pretty much was the only one globally that had a substantial head start
Yeah
I reckon the american ones gonna be more likely to have bad side effects
idk why everyone said functions
Relations so much worse than functions ngl
How so <:kekw:775423225400262656>
"Idk, Oxford one seems better because been in development for longer, people working there have higher standard of education and I don't reckon they'd send it out without overtesting. The other 2 that they're trying to push had a late start and Imo, doesn't seem like they cared much about side effects lol"
Hopefully doesn't give everyone aids tho
If everyone had a vaccine then it be fine
Get vaccine
And sue if it gives me Aids

MEng like good for industry
"Apparently MSc good for research, so good for Uni jobs"
Pretty much
MEng more practical and specialised
MSc more general and research bassed
whereas MEng has to be done by CS students
Main difference is that MSc can be done by maths students etc
But CS comes under engineering and sciences lol
MEng means master of engineering
Pretty sure they don't do BEng haha
Yeah but my actual course im on now is MEng lol
So basically USA and UK make most money

Kfc vegan burger litro like nearly same level as normal kfc ngl
The meat market abuses animals but also adds to climate change so it‚Äôs a problem in more than one way lol
"Tbf, I think that animal meat should be illegal like 100 years from now if vegan alternatives are available that taste 100% identical and can be made sustainably"
My friends are Muslims and they eat maccies all the time lmao
Are the votes anonymous or?
"> so just the blessing is the difference is my guess
<@342291229209264140>  probably"
"No clue, but ik that Judaism, Christianity and Islam are pretty much all based on the same thing, just have different prophets"
"Pretty much, they‚Äôre all based on the same thing anyways"
"> Traditional Jewish thought has expressed the view that all meat must come from animals that have been slaughtered according to Jewish law. These strict guidelines require the animal be killed by a single cut across the throat to a precise depth, severing both carotid arteries, both jugular veins, both vagus nerves, the trachea and the esophagus, no higher than the epiglottis and no lower than where cilia begin inside the trachea, causing the animal to bleed to death. Orthodox Jews explain that this ensures the animal dies instantly without unnecessary suffering, but many animal rights activists view the process as cruel, claiming that the animal may not lose consciousness immediately, and activists have called for it to be banned"
"> Its really not that confusing. Israel is a country, Judaism is a religion
<@155351993655885824>  yeah but why it‚Äôs kosher getting banned?"
How is kosher getting banned?
"> <@274261420932202498> this is where the whole anti semitism thing comes from.
<@364080325074354176>  this is litro so confusing lol"

"> i doubt a brexiteer would have an opinion on this
<@342291229209264140>  yeah I don‚Äôt lmao"
Would a brexiteer vote for or against this?
"> just about the 4 motions and why people should vote against
<@!131892413525393410>  why do I vote against the Israeli thing"

Mike Joy when you tell him the module videos are trash

No
Do it
Ngl but I think @ everyone would be acceptable if Mike starts getting roasted
15 seconds
Say an overwhelming majority are annoyed with his videos
Someone roast Mike
What‚Äôs it say? Cos I‚Äôm on mobile lmao
SOMEONE NEEDS TO SAY 15 SECOND LECTURES ARE NOT ACCEPTABLE
DESTROY

Let‚Äôs see the chart
Within CS?
It true?
Please don‚Äôt say you two have had frick with each other already?
CS student implies is virgin
NEF BASTION
ILL BE BASITON
ILL BE WIDOWNAKER
WHAT ABOUT WIDOAKER
IM ALREADY TRACER
MAYBE ILL BE TRACER
Who said that?
Problem is they‚Äôre mostly biased
"> <@!274261420932202498> south africa's voluntarily dismantled their nuclear programme... they haven't been nuked yet
<@!493302418772197377>  What I mean is that, as long as one country doesn‚Äôt cooperate, there will never be peace and Lw won‚Äôt work"
"> we have failed
<@!493302418772197377>  ask next Tuesday"
"If you go, ‚Äúwe are peace now‚Äù then another country who don‚Äôt have good morals I.e. North Korea just gonna nuke df out of them lol"
"Left views are good to an extent, but are unviable if not everyone agrees"
Politics imo shouldn‚Äôt be on a side basis
I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a simple as that
Idk
Eh
Farage is more like a centralist tho tbf
"> there isn't really a left wing version of farage
<@271351071882870784>  ye I agree with that"
There probs are
But either way both suck imo lol
I think far left is more acceptable than far right in terms of how society look at you
He‚Äôs really far right too so people hate them more
Yeah
Pretty sure he‚Äôs the only person who‚Äôs actually got prosecuted üò≠ü§£
He got arrested for breaking covid rules
"> pretty sure tommy robinson is easy to scapegoat, because he is also a cunt
<@271351071882870784>  pretty much"
"> he's mostly a massive cunt who only debates people he can scapegoat
<@271351071882870784>  Tommy Robinson"
You shouldn‚Äôt agree with  everything someone says but he‚Äôs mostly spot on
I agree with him on the most part tbh
"> piers morgan is special
<@271351071882870784>  he‚Äôs my waifu"
And then trump gets covid and they like haha now die
Like the Kim John Un got ill and they were like oh no
And the news are really left wing too
"> but most twitter users are left wing
<@271351071882870784>  exactly"
And then they had the biggest loss in Labours history ü§£
So many people thought labour was gonna destroy them
Similar thing with labour and conservs
In think the majority of Trump‚Äôs voters cba using social media to promote him in fear of being called racist
Trump gonna win imo
So how long till it‚Äôs over lol
He was talking about it
Find it so funny if he upgrades now lol
Also Matt has like the ¬£6K MacBook
Got the socks init
Nope
Apple is like the bible for the cult
Less cringe than ‚Äúplease join for the US elections‚Äù
No it‚Äôs not lol
And say that we need him cos he‚Äôs an expert lol
That‚Äôs something that would actually be cool
"I think if you really want him to join, try a week today for the Apple Event"
They‚Äôre not out for a good few weeks
Staying up for the results
No
This seems hella cringe ngl
"> She wasn't READY
<@!493302418772197377>  that‚Äôs rape"

Like I think it‚Äôs the hint ones
"> That looks like MULTIPLAYER
<@226722934184476674>  I think it‚Äôs phantoms maybe?"
And all huge

Even hollow knight was quicker lmao

"> Instead of misclicking and  doing same ending 3 times in row
<@226722934184476674>  rip, I only did shura for the trophy lol"
Cos it looks like they have ghosts in it lol
Pretty sure there‚Äôs more than they‚Äôre saying tbh
Yeah
Ages ago I know that
Nah like March to may time maybe?
Sekiro update this week less goooo

"Yeah I know, Greatsword being an obvious one lol"

"> yeh ik vaati did a vid on that
<@376714414830911490>  I swear he talked about Gael and Loragarius in one of the later ones"
Like the ending of DS3 litro points towards blood
"Imo I think dark souls and bloodborne link really well, some people disagree tho"
He‚Äôs kinda an anti-villain
Tho tbf I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs meant to be a bad person
Yeah haha
Same voice actor too tho
Yeah but he‚Äôs a giant spider in it
In Bloodborne lmao
He even survives after dark souls
That‚Äôs sad
Yeah pretty sure
Yeah haha rip
Yeah hehe
Or that boss from dark souls 1 owo
The only spider I like is Muffet from Undertale lmao
Matt thinks Knack  is underrated

What gay?
Should say top 20 cos there‚Äôs too many in the top 10 lmao
Mob psycho 100 deffo top 10 all time
"Nah but for real, one punch man"
One piece lmao
Only better one imo is the Akatski
"Saboady really close too, that‚Äôs episode 350 ish. The worst generation is one of the coolest groups in anime tbf"
Whole cake island is still my favourite arc of any anime every tbf
Time skip is where it‚Äôs at tho
"450 is pretty big, time skip is 500"
350 is another good part
But earlier there‚Äôs some good scenes but it‚Äôs more like an intro to the story
Imo it only starts getting good episode 100ish
"Still tho, if you ever feel like catching up on op (which you probs won‚Äôt lmao), it‚Äôs deffo top tier"
Too many lmao
*Bleach*
"> like a certain manga ...
<@376714414830911490>  *cough cough HXH*"
Like 993 chapters in and it still doesn‚Äôt feel close to ending really lol
"Normally I‚Äôd base it on genre, but one piece still the best imo"
Mines easy tbh
What‚Äôs everyone‚Äôs favourite anime then?
Haha
Heard that‚Äôs good
Might read Tommie tho
Nah haven‚Äôt tbh
But not story wise
Uzumaki was creative horror wise
Art style deffo the grab tho
Yeah he‚Äôs alright
I‚Äôm pretty chill with that tbh tho lol
Dark humour
"> lynch time
<@503297793037959179>  woah now ü§£"
That‚Äôs the last one I forgot
Also I read Uzumaki too lol
I‚Äôd get killed by some people lmao
Ahhhh nah I probs won‚Äôt make one rip
"> got MAL?
<@503297793037959179>  what‚Äôs that?"
"One piece, DBS, Boruto (garbage lmao), Demon Slayer, MHA, OPM, MPO and death note one shot the only ones I‚Äôve read lol"
"Nah, I‚Äôve only read a few mangas tbh"
Season 2 took so long to come out that it kinda fell into my void rip
